- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkRedman00
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching myself programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C, C++, and refining my java as I believe they are the fundamental languages. I plan on understanding the basics and then beginning to solve problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can.
